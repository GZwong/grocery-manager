# grocery-manager
This repository stores the scripts to read, process grocery receipts (primarily Sainsbury's orders) and creates a web app to track these orders.

Currently, the project uses python to extract text from receipt PDFs and process the texts into a readable form.

In the future, it may be worth experimenting with JavaScript.
